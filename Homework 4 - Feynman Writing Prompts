Callback Functions
    A callback function is a function or piece of code that can be passed into another function as an argument or parameter. 

Closure
    Closure allows functions inside of outer functions to use the variables in the outer functions. 

Arguments
    The arguments keyword allows you to access the arguments in an array full of arguments to pass into a function. 

Recursion
    Recursion is when a function calls itself. And it requires identifying a base case that identifies when to stop calling itself. 

Prototype
    An object prototype is also an object. Every object also has a prototype, but all objects inherit their properties and methods from their prototype. 
    
Constructors
    A constructor method is a special method for creating an object. They are special types of functions. A constructor returns an object that has methods and properties that fill out the same way every time itâ€™s called.
